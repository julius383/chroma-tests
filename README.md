## Chromaprint song detection tests

In this repo is code that tests the viability of various algorithms for
comparing sets of chromaprint fingerprints for the purpose of matching
one fingerprint to another.

Comparison is done between samples of various sizes and the fingerprint
of the entire song. Additionally comparison to a reference is also done
to test how samples compares to a random different song.
